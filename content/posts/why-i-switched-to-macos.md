## Linux is awesome

During the last couple of years, I used to switch frequently between different
operating systems. Like most people, I've started my introduction into computers
with Microsoft Windows, which in my case, was around the year 2002.

However, since I'm a curious person and also a somebody who likes to try and do 
things himself, I quickly fell in love with Linux. The freedom you have in Linux
is just superb. I can customize everything to my own taste. Completely. I can 
make Linux my own and I am also able to know what is going on behind the scenes 
not only by looking at the logs, but also by looking at the documentation of 
each tool, including the man pages.


### Drawbacks

In an office environment where it is not only needed to create code, but to also
handle documents of different types, it is not always easy and sometimes even
impossible to find a good application which can handle a specific file and at
the same time doesn't look like it was invented 20 years ago and never updated.
I'm a sucker for a good and nice looking UI. 
_The application does what it is supposed to do_ is not enough for me 
personally when the UI is looking bad.

Also, sometimes I'd have these small problems like a `NetworkManager` not working
properly anymore after an update, so I'd have to spend time researching why it 
happened and on how to fix it. It was also always interesting, because I love 
learning and that made me understand and learn a lot. 
However, it also took the focus from me for a task which I actually wanted 
to finish or to invest time in like side projects.  And since I didn't have 
just one problem, but multiple once every now and then, so the time invested 
in fixing things and in finding proper applications and tools, added up.

Most problems I've had, you probably wouldn't, since most people use a desktop
environment like GNOME in e.g. Ubuntu, 
but I used [the i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org) which was the main 
reason that I kept staying with only Linux for so long. It's efficient, it is 
perfect for my coding workflow and frequent context/window switchting, but the
main thing me was, I could use a mainly keyboard driven workflow. Instead of
Ubuntu (which I've also used for a long time), I've used Arch Linux btw. Thus,
I could learn more but also many things had to be installed manually but the 
combination with i3 made setting up tools like network management with username
and password authentication much more cumbersome. In the beginning it was fun
but like I said, it took time from me which I wanted to invest in different 
areas and the older I become, the more I want to shut out the clutter and 
focus on the important things. It's now important for me to set proper 
priorites wich are to 

* Become and stay fit, physically aswell as mentally
* Spend more time with my family
* Be a good and up-to-date Software Developer
* Get more skills in the DevOps field
* Read more books like [Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)



## So why macOS?

### A Little Backstory

In 2012 I needed a laptop, so I could study efficiently during my university
time in the field of computer science. I was searching for an Ultrabook and 
didn't have an Apple device in mind. I really was Apple hater one could say.
I just couldn't understand why somebody would pay that much for a device which
has worse specs, more limits and less freedom then a proper laptop with Linux
on it. To my surprise, most Ultrabooks were similar priced or even higher priced
than the MacBook Air back then, since Apple also offered a student discount.

I was really surprised and very skeptical at the same time. Even though I found
the MacBook Air good looking, I hesitated. I searched the web for advantages
and disadvantages and as expected, found people on the one side who thought 
like my past self and asked themselves why somebody would pay so much for - 
only because it is Apple?

On the other hand there were the so called "Apple fanboys" saying everything 
Apple does is good. The devices have their quality to defend the pricing and
that you have an awesome experience when having multiple Apple devices with
something like [AirDrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop). That sounded
like people were either being very naive or some salesperson, trying to justify
why Apple devices are so expensive. 

"Why should I want to trap myself inside the Apple ecosystem and why should
I want to buy another Apple device like an overpriced iPhone when I can 
have an Android phone for much less with even better specs. I haven't even
decided to buy a MacBook anyways!" â€“ Me about 8 years ago

After speaking with some friends, I've bought the MacBook Air for around $999, 
which was a lot for me. But I've quickly realized that many things which I've
read before were indeed true, which holds until today. 

### Why I Learned to Like Apple

* The build quality is awesome
* The OS is neat and the UI is looking good out of the box
* Office applications can easily be found
* Even large files can be shared quickly via AirDrop
* I can quickly connect to AppleTV without any extra configuration
* I can copy paste between different Apple devices 
  (like copy a file on my iPhone and paste it on my Mac)
* I can use UNIX and therefore the terminal, so many commands coming from Linux,
  also work on macOS
* They care about privacy
* Apple's _Everything just works_, is actually true in my case

And till this day, my MacBook Air 2012 is still working without any problems.

I'm way more productive in macOS, since I can focus on the task at hand 
instead of worrying about finding essential tools which work well for the whole
system. I even found a good tiling window manager called 
[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai). 

Granted, I have less freedom and am much more limited than on Linux. But I
also think differently than I used to. I don't have to customize so many 
things anymore. It was cool but also a bit time wasting. A good sensible
default is all I need to be productive in the areas where I want to be.
Back in time I've had much more time to try different things, to troubleshoot 
and to learn things which are not mandatory or didn't get me further. It was an
awesome time learning Linux a little more in depth. But nowadays I have 
different and more real life obligations and I had to learn to set my 
priorities straight.

I'm not saying Linux isn't worth learning or using. It absolutely is and if I
could spend more free time, I probably still would use Linux. Even though
I've had an MacBook Air since 2012, I mostly used Linux for Dev work 
(I've had a laptop from work which ran Linux and which I also used for personal
things). I just came to the conclusion to only use macOS as my everyday horse
recently, because I've realized that it makes my life easier. I'm still using
Linux in a DevOps environment via SSH etc. 

We live in an environment with variety and most of the time, we do have the 
freedom to choose and everybody has their own taste, so use it. But also 
don't try to force people into having the same taste as yourself.
